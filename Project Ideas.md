**Football Twitter Sentiment Analysis:**

	Main Objective : To make a visualization which shows the sentiment of the Tweeters concerning a match

	Sub-objective :
	 * One viz which shows the range of emotions for the whole match (Viz_Range)
	 * One viz for live emotion tracking for each team (Viz_Live)
	 * One viz for showing location of tweets (Viz_Location)

	Method and Challenges:

	Viz_Range:
	 - We can make a x-y axis graph which shows various emotions on the plot at various degrees. 
	   This will give us options to show many emotions in one graph or viz. 
	 - Challenge here will be to detech sarcastic tweets
	   e.g. "DAMN! FUCK ! What a through ball" This could potentially be classified as a 'tense' emotion
	   Possible solutions could be, building a corpus of such commonly used phrases which can help us classify the tweets in correct category.
	Viz_Live:
	 - A two sided bar graph (horizontal). It will help show or quantify the type of emotion at that instant.
	   e.g. At 20min 30sec we have 1000 positive tweets and 30 negative tweets. 
	   We can show two bars for that instant, one going vertically up which represents positive tweets.
	   The other going vertically down which would represent negative tweets.
	 - We can make this for a match as a whole or also for seperate teams
	 - Challenge here would be the sheer number of tweets that come in. 
	   Maybe we can capture tweets for specific hashtags while match is on. 
	   Later we can visualize the whole match's timeline and publish. (Defeats the purpose?)
	Viz_Location:
	 - A location density plot on a map for originating locations for all tweets

	Possible insights?
	 - Which team is playing better and when?
	 - Which team has more supporters? (Potential duplication)
	 - Which team has supporters from which region?
	 - Who is the main player (most talked about) in a side?
	 - Deduction of playing style of a team?????
